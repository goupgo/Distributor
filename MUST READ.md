Due to some reason that I have not figued out yet, empty folders cannot be uploaded to github, so there will be a slight problem, but we'll get this fix very easily.
First, create two folders in your Desktop, "Mess" and "Organised"
Second, in the "Organised" folder that you have created, create two folders, "image" and "video"
Thanks for reading this, there will be more formats available!
Have a nice day!
